Please read the attached licese statement.

Quick start:
Here is a quick way to get this thing to work:
1.Compile
2.Run
3.???
4.Profit!!!

Really, though here is the legit thing:
Your OS folder should have two sub-folders 'source' and 'obj'
source is monitored for the code and used for makefile gen,
obj is the output dir for object files and the dependency files.

Also, the source folder is treated as the include folder.
On source file rename/delete the needed changes will be reflect, if running in the continous mode.
Don't forget to set the path of the OS folder, either in the code, or in the console by "set C:\your\os\path" which contains the source and obj folders.

Final disclaimer:
I think it should work on linux, as the program was written to work with cygwin ( mainly using the unix path notation), and most of the code does use that convention or
 is otherwise agnostic of that matter.
But for some critical sections, it might not work.
